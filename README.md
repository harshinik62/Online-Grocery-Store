# Online-Grocery-Store

In this project, I have created a database or backend which stores all the details of the store. Then I have created a website or front end to display all the details of the store to the users. The front end and the database will be linked together by using a php file. We can directly store the data into the database, else we can also enter the data through the front end.

This project database is created for an Online Grocery Store. This database contains details about the following entities : 
1)	user 
2)	account
3)	category
4)	item
5)	cart
6)	order
7)	card
